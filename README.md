Challenge to find location of items

From the challenge description:
Imagine you need to write a program for quickly finding location of things. A user would enter information as "dance shoes - basement", "tent - garage", "passport - safe", "beer - fridge", "buckwheat - big pantry". Then the user would want to know where the beer is and use the program to tell. 

The challenge wasn't finished in time - no big deal - I have a use for this otherwise. Glad I got this one!
