Challenge to find location of items

From the challenge description:
Imagine you need to write a program for quickly finding location of things. A user would enter information as "dance shoes - basement", "tent - garage", "passport - safe", "beer - fridge", "buckwheat - big pantry". Then the user would want to know where the beer is and use the program to tell. What data structure would you use to store the information and why?
